# VedaChain - Ayurvedic Traceability (Frontend)
This is a simple static frontend for a demo Ayurvedic traceability dashboard and farmer collection form.
Files included:
- index.html
- farmer.html
- style.css
- script.js

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Create a repository on GitHub.
2. Upload these files to the repository root (via git or web upload).
3. In repo Settings → Pages, set source to `main` (or `gh-pages`) and root `/`.
4. Optionally add `.nojekyll` (already included) to prevent Jekyll processing.

This is a frontend demo. Connect to your backend APIs to store and fetch real data.
